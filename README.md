Advance survey analysis with NLP algorythm.

Recommandation algorythm logic applied to a user survey where the intention is to introduce compatible users to oneanother.

### What is this repository for? ###

1. This is a portefolio repo to allow external peek into some of my data advance analytic skills with Python.
2. This repo includes Jupyter Lab Notebooks.
    - SH_personas_EDA-Cleaning.ipynb: Data wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis.
    - SH_personas_ML_Analysis.ipynb: Applying NMF as way to cluster respondants in user groups (personas). I used each respondant individual answers as NLP tokens, jointed them together like a sentence and applied NMF model to exact most commun answers amongst clusters of respondants. 

### Why are the datasets missing? ###

* Data sets contains personnal information I cannot make public.
* You can still see the Notebook cells as processed by me.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install Anaconda or miniConda to create virtual environment and manage package easily
* Create a venv using the requirements.txt as a reference to install required dependencies ($ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt)
* In terminal, clone the repo.
* In terminal, from the directory, open a Jupyter Lab session by typing $ jupyter lab
